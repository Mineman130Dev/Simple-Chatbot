# JoltChat
## Overview
JoltChat is a lightweight, interactive chatbot built with Python and tkinter. This experimental project demonstrates conversational interface design with a simple yet engaging AI companion that can remember your name and respond to basic commands.

### Features

- **Personalized Interaction**: JoltChat remembers your name between conversations
- **Conversational UI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with tkinter
- **Basic Command Recognition**: Responds to a set of simple commands
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on macOS, Windows(coming soon), and Linux(coming soon) systems

### Current Development Status
JoltChat is an early prototype showcasing fundamental chatbot concepts. It serves as both a functional tool and a demonstration of Python GUI development skills.

### Known Issues
The following issues are currently being addressed:

- **User name persistence**: The name storage functionality in "name.txt" is not working correctly
- **Command recognition**: The "**What's my name**" command is not properly implemented

### Roadmap
A complete rewrite of **JoltChat** is in development that will:

- Rebuild the core conversation engine for better interactions
- Fix all existing bugs and stability issues
- Add new features and conversation capabilities
- Polish the user interface for a more refined experience
